This is a CLI made for the Shopee developers case.

## Dependecies

The main dependency is [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/).

Be sure to install it before running this application.

To ensure you've installed run

```bash
node --version
```

and check if you see something like `v14.x`

Also, check if `npm` is installed correctly as well with

```bash
npm --version
```

## How to run

Once you've installed NodeJS, access the cloned repository from the terminal and run

```bash
yarn install
```

if you have `yarn`, or

```bash
npm run install
```

to download libraries.

When it finishes, run

```bash
